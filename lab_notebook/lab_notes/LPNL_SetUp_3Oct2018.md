# Litter Priming Nutrient Set Up
## 3 Oct 2018
## Litter priming nutrient limitation set up


On October 2nd 2018 4 Ekman dredge samples were collected  from approximately 1m deep water in LPP about 20m from the shore towards the dam-side.  
The sediments were then combined into a 5 gallon bucket and left uncovered overnight in the lab.


On October 3rd 2018 the sediments were passed through a 250 micrometer mesh net to remove macroinvertebrates and CPOM. 


The filtered sediments were homogenized and 100 ml of the slurry was added to 36 250ml glass septum-top jar (12.5 cm tall, 5 cm opening). 


Each jar was filled to the lip with pond water that was collected from the surface of LPP at the same time as the sediments.


The pond water was stored in the refrigerator overnight at 4 degrees Celsius.


The jars were then placed into the incubator (which was off) at room temperature to settle them. 
*Jars added to the incubator at 3:30pm on October 3rd, 2108. 
*Incubator temp= 19 degrees Celsius 


## Sediment initial LoI and CN 
### LOI
6, 10ml samples of sediment slurry were collected with a syringe with the tip removed. 


The samples were placed into pre-weighed ceramic crucibles

## Inorganic Nutrients
2 samples of 50ml pond water (collected Oct. 2nd 2018) were filtered through GFF and frozen in acid-washed falcon tubes for inorganic nutrients


## October 10th 2018 
The jars had been in the dark in the incubator at room temperature (22 degrees Celsius) since October 3rd 2018.


After a week the overlying water was still cloudy and there was some brown flocculent material in the water column. The sediments settled and had approximately 2cm of dark grey with about 3mm of a lighter grey surface layer. 


On October 17th the jars had now been in the dark incubator at room temperature (19 degrees Celsius) for 2 weeks. 


## Water Change 
The water was changed by removing approximately 5cm of overlying water with a siphon and then over filling the jars with LPP water (from Oct. 3rd 2018) for 60 seconds.


Approximately 7.75 L of LPP water was used to change the water.  
On October 17th 2018 the water in the jars were changed again the same way and put back into the room temperature incubator. 


## Leaf samples 
On October 17th 2018 senescent tulip poplar leaves (collected fall 2013) were placed into a bucket full (approx. 20 L) of Di water which was covered and leff at room temperature for 72 hours. 


After 72 hours 700, 1 cm circles were cut out of the leaves and placed into 7, 100m beakers filled with Di water which were then covered with aluminum foil and placed into the fridge.

# LPNL Jar Set-up and Experiment Beginning
## 31 Oct 2018

## Jar set up
On October 31st 2018, 3 ml of water was removed from each jar 

10 leaf disks were then added to the top of the sediment surface. Then a wire shelf was placed over the sediment and 10 more leaf disks were added to the top of the shelf. 

NOTE: 1YGYN-12 has two extra leaves. 

## Jar Label Key

*  NG = no glucose addition
*  NN = no nutrient addition
*  YG = 1 ml of glucose stock added
*  YN = 1 ml of N-stock and 1 ml of P-stock added
 
### Tape Labels

## Set-up Notes

After the leaves were added to the jars:

*  1ml of glucose stock was then added to all the YG jars.

*  1ml of DIP and DIN stock was added to all YN jars.   

*  The remaining balance of the 3 ml removed was made up by adding DI water.


All the jars were placed into the incubator at 4:15 pm and 22 degrees Celsius.

## Initial LOI and C:N

10 leaf discs were added to each of 4 pre-weighed crucibles dried at 50 degrees Celsius and ashed at 550 degrees Celsius for 5 hours for the initial LOI measurements.
 
| Crucible # | # of leaf discs | Cruc mass |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | 
|     11         |      10              |   11.8906g  |
|     7           |      10              |   12.2008g  |
|      10        |      10              |   12.9375g  |
|     1           |       7               |   13.1362g  |
|     9           |       10             |   11.6695g  |

The seven leaves in crucible number 1 were dried and ground and then added to a pre-weighed scint vial for C:N analysis.

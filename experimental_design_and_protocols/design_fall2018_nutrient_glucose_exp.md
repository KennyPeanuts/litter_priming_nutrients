## Justification

In a previous [experiment](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/sediment_priming) we found that tulip poplar leaf discs that were in contact with the sediments lost more toughness and C mass than leaf discs that were not in contact with the sediments.  We hypothesized that results are due to the priming of the refractory organic matter in the leaves (C:N ~ 50) by the labile organic matter in the sediments (C:N ~ 10), which likely derives from phytodetritus. 

Possible mechanisms for the priming effect include:
 1. the use of labile C from the LOM to eliminate energy limitation in the decomposer community,  
 2. increased N and P availability from mineralization of the LOM, or
 3. both. 

Experiments with living algae support labile C production as the mechanism, since the living algae would compete for limited inorganic nutrients.  However, the mechanism responsible for the effect observed with algal detritus need not be the same.

## Question and Hypotheses


### Research Question 

This project asks the question:

> Is the increased decomposition rate of leaf litter in the presence of pond sediments, due to the supply of inorganic N and P, and labile C from the sediments?


### Hypotheses

Broadly, we are hypothesizing that the priming effect of the sediments is the result of increased availability of inorganic N and P, and labile C resulting from the mineralization of phytodetritus. 

This hypothesis presumes that the decomposition of litter in the pond water is limited by inorganic N and P, and labile C.

#### Specific Hypotheses

1. If decomposition of leaf material is limited by inorganic N and P, then additions of N and P will increase the rate of decomposition and the effect will be greater in the absence of pond sediments.

2. If decomposition of leaf material is limited by labile C, then additions of glucose will increase the rate of decomposition and the effect will be greater in the absence of pond sediments.

3. Increased nutrient availability (N, P, and labile C), will increase the bacteria to fungal biomass ratio of the decomposer community.

| Treatments | Levels |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Sediments  | Yes / No |
| Nutrients  | Yes / No |
| Glucose    | Yes / No |
| Duration   | 2 weeks / 12 weeks |

### Design and Replicates

|*2 Weeks* |      |         |
| -------  | ---- | ------- |
|              | No Glucose | Glucose |
| No Nutrients | 4          | 4       |
| Nutrients    | 4          | 4       |

|*12 Weeks* |      |        |
| -------  | ---- | ------- |
|              | No Glucose | Glucose |
| No Nutrients | 4          | 4       |
| Nutrients    | 4          | 4       |


## Set-up

 * Total Bottles needed = 16 for 2 week harvest + 16 for 12 week harvest = 32 bottles
 * Total Leaf Discs needed = (10 discs on sediments + 10 discs on shelf) * 32 bottles = 640 leaf discs
 * Total Nutrient Solution needed 

*TO BE COMPLETED*

## Protocols
### Field Sampling

1. Do a YSI profile.
2. Collect 1 L of water for chlorophyll and nutrient samples.
3. Filter water through GFF filter - freeze filter for chlorophyll - freeze filtrate for nutrients

### Initial Bottle Set-up

1. Collect 3 Ekman dredge samples from Lancer Park Pond away from the immediate shoreline.`
2. Pass the sediments through 250 um mesh to remove macroinvertebrates and CPOM.
3. Collect 20 L of pond surface water.
4. Homogenize the sediments and then add 100 ml of slurry to each jar.
5. Fill the remaining volume of the jar with pond water and allow to settle in the dark.
6. Collect a 3 replicate 10 ml samples of sediment slurry and add to pre-weighed crucibles for LOI.

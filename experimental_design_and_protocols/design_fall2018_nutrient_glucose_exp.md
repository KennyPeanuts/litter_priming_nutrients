# Design of the Nutrient and Glucose Addition - Priming Experiment

## Justification

In a previous [experiment](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/sediment_priming) we found that tulip poplar leaf discs that were in contact with the sediments lost more toughness and C mass than leaf discs that were not in contact with the sediments.  We hypothesized that results are due to the priming of the refractory organic matter in the leaves (C:N ~ 50) by the labile organic matter in the sediments (C:N ~ 10), which likely derives from phytodetritus. 

Possible mechanisms for the priming effect include:
 1. the use of labile C from the LOM to eliminate energy limitation in the decomposer community,  
 2. increased N and P availability from mineralization of the LOM, or
 3. both. 

Experiments with living algae support labile C production as the mechanism, since the living algae would compete for limited inorganic nutrients.  However, the mechanism responsible for the effect observed with algal detritus need not be the same.

## Question and Hypotheses


### Research Question 

This project asks the question:

> Is leaf litter decomposition in the presence and absence of pond sediments limited by inorganic N and P and labile C?


### Hypotheses

1. If decomposition of leaf material is limited by inorganic N and P, then additions of N and P will increase the rate of decomposition

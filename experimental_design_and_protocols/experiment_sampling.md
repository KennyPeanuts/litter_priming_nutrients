## Purpose
Protocol for the sampling of the nutrient limitation of litter priming exp.

## Response Variables

| Response | Measured as: |
| -------- | ------------ |
| leaf mass | LOI 550 |
| toughness | mass required to puncture leaf in penetrometer |
| C:N | C:N from mass spec |
| fungal biomass | ergosterol concentration |
| bacterial biomass | DAPI count |
| N and P concentration | DIN and DIP analysis |
| lDOC concentration | DOC analyzer |

## Protocol

For each bottle:

### Water Analysis

1) Beginning with the NG-NN treatments, remove 50 ml of water with a designated syringe pipette for each treatment and filter through a GFF filter into a 50 ml falcon tube, rinsing the pipette with 2X 50 ml between samples.

2) Beginning with the NG-NN treatments, remove 50 ml of water with a designated syringe pipette for each treatment and add to a pre-ashed septum-top DOC vial.

### Leaf Sampling

1) Siphon off any remaining water to expose the leaves on the shelf.

2) Remove 2 discs and place into a scintillation vial with 10 ml of HPLC-grade methanol, then cap tightly, seal with parafilm and freeze.

3) Remove 3 discs and very gently rinse with DI water on the sieve, then measure toughness on the penetrometer.

4) Following the penetrometer measurements, place these 3 leaf discs into a pre-weighed and labeled scintillation vial for C:N analysis.

5) Remove 1 leaf disc and place into an autoclaved scintillation vial with 10 ml of 2% filter sterilized formalin.

6) Remove the remaining 4 leaf discs and place into a pre-weighed crucible for LOI analysis.

7) Remove the shelf and repeat steps 2 - 6

NOTE: Keep careful notes on the number of leaves in each sample because it may differ from the intended amount.
